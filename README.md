# PageNumbering
**Objectives**:
You will write a page with long list of contact information. You are required to add buttons to the bottom of the page
and show different sets of student information when each button is clicked. You will be working with DOM and change
HTML on a web page.
**Instructions**:
You must generate a page with a list of some random users. You have already been provided with the starting html and
CSS files.
You must construct the page and add pagination with each page showing 10 users.
In the CSS file, some styles added for the pagination in case you want to use them.
You need to write a JS program to receive some random users from the following public API (you can use other APIs if
you know any). As you can see you can define how many users you want to retrieve.

At the present time, you do not need to fetch the data directly, but you need to manually create a JSON file as your
database. Some data is already extracted and saved in data.js. Spend some time and extract at least 22 data objects.
break all of the list into multiple pages of 10 profiles, so you can go back and forth to any of the pages. Each page should
only show the corresponding 10 profiles in that page. A Mockup of how each page should look like is provided below.
**Requirements**:
For this project, avoid using the popular jQuery library. All code for this project must be your own, and must be plain
JavaScript. Avoid using any other libraries, plugins or code snippets for any aspect of this project, including JavaScript
paginate() function.
